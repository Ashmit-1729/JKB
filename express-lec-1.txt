express installation:
npm init 
npm install express

then we can see-
node modules which contains all the 
packages which are needed for express to work and
node modules / express/express.js
it contains all the express code

if there are more packages , 
npm i
it will download all the packages 
needed , which are there in packages.json file

npm uninstall express
to uninstall express

gitignore the node_modules folder
make a .gitignore and mention node_modules

there are various stores such as pnpm which is fast, and yarn

express theory:
its a node js framework for web related things. Framework is a structure which needs to be followed. web framework 
help in :
1. Routing
2. Middleware-control things
3. Templating-output minimum html
4. Req/Res
5. Security
6. Rapid Development

simple express demo:
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send([1,2,3])
//automatically content type will be 
application/json
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})

to run: 
node index.js
or
node --watch index.js


STATIC FILES:
app.use(express.static('public'))
include all static files like html,
css
in that , then you dont need 
to add routes separately

if you add 'asset/' in static files path use the same while linking



DYNAMIC ROUTING- route parameters
different url , different data, 
same html+css

you cannot access post request
using browser because its by default get, hence use thunder client which is a vs code extension, or postman, or html
form using method = POST

host in Render

1.Routing is completed
